NFT AGGREGATOR
by Shayakhmetov Madi(CS-2101) for advanced python courses.

INSTALLATION:
You need to download whole folder "ass4" from my github, and that it is all that needed for installation. :)

USAGE of website:
So, you need to launch the code from your vscode or any other code editor. 
This will give you the url for the website (http://127.0.0.1:5000), it is the main page for the NFT AGGREGATOR.
Next you need to sign up and log in, into your account. 
After that, you will have an access to NFT AGGREGATOR.

USAGE OF NFT AGGREGATOR:
To use this application, you just copy the address of any nft and paste it inside of bar. After that, press the 'get info' button and you will have information about needed nft.

EXAMPLES:
just take some random nft address and insert it(2L9BBFPUnRPfgLZSdc2FQNWDgxKRdWkpV7YCnD8mJbLJ), information will be saved into database and result will be shown on the screen.

POSSIBLE PROBLEM:
I spent my last 2 hours before the deadline to solve the problem with login page. For some reason, when you try to log in, it just refreshes the page and dont log in you... MY CODE IS IDEAL, AND IT IS REALLY ANNOYING THAT IT DOES NOT LOG YOU IN. I SPENT 2 HOURS TO FIND THE PROBLEM BUT I COUlD NOT DO THAT.
If we ignore that, than everything works perfectly!
